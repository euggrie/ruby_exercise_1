* Design the structure of the code that will contain a main class
**Sequence** that will defines errors and return the ordered sequence of jobs.
A secondary class **Job** that
will process the string input and create a *Job* object with *name* and *dependency* attributes.
And finally unit tests for every scenario.

* Write methods for the **Job** class that will take the string input and (by lines) and return an object with the job's name and the dependency as attributes. Also it will contain a method that check if the job has a dependency or not.

* Write methods for the **Secuence** class that will create an array containing every job as an object and sort it according to dependencies.

* Write conditions that check for errors.
